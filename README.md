# Protest Word Clouds
The following word clouds were created using Geo-Tagged tweets related to protests in three different cities in Washington State.

> ## Seattle

## Search Parameters
My word cloud was built upon geo-tagged tweets in Seattle, Spokane, and Olympia with the search parameter of "Protest". I chose a radius of 10 miles so that it could include most, if not all, of each city. Because of these search parameters, I am able to make a comparison between commonly tweeted words on the topic of protests in varying geographic locations. I wanted to make this comparison because I was interested in how geography might change opinions or topics relating to protests and political/social issues.

## Comparing Word Clouds
The Seattle word cloud has significantly more words on in, which makes sense because Seattle is more densely populated than Spokane and Olympia. Each word cloud has some inclusion of Greta Thunburg, which makes sense given her participation in a protest recently that caused her to be arrested. Seattle has many words associated with the livestreaming platform, "Twitch", including the platform name itself as well as "Mods", "Chat", and "Platform" whereas the other two have nothing relevant to the platform. This causes Seattle's word cloud to have less "political" related words, whereas Olympia has the most "political" words of the three, including words like "President", "Proclamation", "Tyrannical", "Capitol", and "Politicians". This is likely because Seattle has more of a younger population than both Olympia and Spokane, causing more of it's tweets to be centered around platforms that are popular with younger generations. Olympia on the other hand is the capitol of Washington, which would increase the likelyhood of people being there for political reasons and causing the tweets to be more centered around politics.

## Interesting Observations
I was surprised to see a large concentration of tweets surrounding the platform Twitch. While I think it is rather common for younger generations to tweet about Twitch, I didn't expect words associated to Twitch to come up under the search parameter of "Protest" since I am unaware of any protests related to Twitch at the moment. In looking more into the data, it seems like it was the same person copy and pasting the same tweet to multiple different people, which makes me wonder how many other users doing things like that affects other commonly used words that appear on the word cloud.

## Potential Research Improvements
Given my interesting observations, I think it might be beneficial to omit copy and paste comments from the same user if given the oppportunity in the future, only taking one of their comments into consideration for the word cloud. This is because it is the exact same thoughts from the same person, which can be misleading in terms of understanding trends in the word cloud between what many people are talking about. I also think that having data from more than 7 days back would allow trends to be more comprehensive and reliable, so making that adjustment would also be beneifical.
